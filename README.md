# Wenzhe Zhang's Notebook

Hi there, my name is Wenzhe Zhang (张文喆), graduate from Tongji University in 2020, and currently working at SAP CIC (Consumer Industry Cloud) Eureka Team as a backend developer, using Java to build microservices. Always keeping curiosity, always learning. This is my notebook to record my working and reading and learning materials, and I am more than happy to share them to everyone.
