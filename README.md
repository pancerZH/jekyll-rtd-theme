# Wenzhe Zhang's Notebook

Hi there, my name is Wenzhe Zhang (张文喆), graduate from Tongji University in 2020, and currently working at SAP CIC (Consumer Industry Cloud) Eureka Team as a backend developer, using Java to build microservices. Always keeping curiosity, always learning. This is my notebook to record my working and reading and learning materials, and I am more than happy to share them to everyone. 

I would go to *University of California San Diego* to participate in the Graduate Schhol of Computer Scinece in 2021 Fall, and I am open to all opportunities of summer intern in 2022.
